        Once upon a time, a speedy hare constantly mocked a slow-moving tortoise.
        Tired of the teasing, the tortoise challenged the hare to a race. Overconfident
        in his abilities, the hare quickly took the lead but decided to rest mid-race.
        Meanwhile, the tortoise continued at a steady pace and, to everyone's surprise,
        won the race while the hare slept.
